# ML-for-diagnosing-degenerative-spinal-disorders
I built this multi-layer convolutional neural network to identify the type and severity of degenerative spinal disorders from MR imaging (axial, sagittal, cranial). The data was from the Kaggle RSNA Degenerative Spinal Disorders Competition. I built this model to help instruct CS Seminar: Machine Learning @ IMSA

Skills used: Data preprocessing; Dataframe Manipulation (pandas); .pkl file manipulation; .dcom file reading, compression and manipulation; building multi-layer complex neural networks with tensorflow; compiling model results; utilizing statistical methods of data interpretation; interpreting model effectiveness using loss and accuracy.

N.B. The file in this repository is an example of how the model worked -- the actual functionality uses a JupyterHub Environment and server because of the size of the model and the amount of data necessary.
